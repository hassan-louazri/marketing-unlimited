Many people fail to optimize their website for search results, and it’s no surprise because it’s tricky business. 

The first thing you should start with is to create a Google Business account. Fill it out with accurate information and relevant keywords. Add pictures, respond to reviews and keep your hours and services updated. Do this correctly and you’re already in the TOP 3 search results, aka, Google’s Local Pack.

Furthermore, your website needs to be clean, REALLY clean, I mean clean on a codebase level.

I’m not talking about headers, colors and buttons. No. I’m talking about the keywords you are using in your metadata, the structure of your website, and how your code is functioning on web and mobile devices.

Having a clean, well-optimized website already sets you apart from most competitors. But we’re not stopping here.

Your next best tool is social media. Yes, social media is not just for personal use - local businesses can harness it to build relationships and drive traffic.
