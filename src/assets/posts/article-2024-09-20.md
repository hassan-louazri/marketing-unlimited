# Earn More Money By Writing Better Stuff: The Undefeated BAR Test

Let's assume that your content looks great and you give good value through your writing.

But looking good isn’t enough. You need to make sure your writing keeps people reading. Once you’ve hooked them, your job is to grease that slide and keep them on the hook.

So how do we do that?

Simple. Use the BAR Test.

### What is This “BAR Test” You’re Talking About?
The BAR Test is undefeated. It’s been working for centuries before, and it’ll keep working for centuries more.

Why? Because it’s based on human to human interaction.

Here’s how it works:

When you write something, ask yourself, “Would I say this to a real person?”

Sounds simple, right? That’s because it is.

Let’s look at an example.

“As a business owner your job is to solve problems. Someone having electrical issues? It’s a good thing you're a certified electrician with your own business to solve that customer's problem. This is the basic principle of running your own business most business owners already know, but what happens when no one knows you even exist? How are we supposed to solve problems if Larry from across the street doesn’t even know who you are as a business? We Market, but we market in a very specific and strategic way that actually allows us to attract clients and make sales.”

By the way, if you made it through this paragraph without skipping half of it… you’re a tough one, honestly. I salute you.

Now, would you actually say that in a conversation? Probably not.

Instead, it might sound more like this:

"Most business owners already know they solve problems for a living. But that’s tough when no one even knows you exist, right?"

The second version is simpler, shorter, and sounds more human. It's something a friend might say to you, not a robot, or an alien trying to mimic English speech.

### Why Conversational Writing Works
People don’t talk like textbooks. They don’t use long, complex sentences in casual conversations. Yet, many writers fall into this trap when they sit down to type.

The more your writing mimics natural speech, the easier it is to read. And if it’s easier to read, people are more likely to keep reading.

That’s the key to better engagement — and ultimately, more sales. Guaranteed.

### “OK, But How Am I Going To Use This BAR Test?”
Here’s the fastest way to improve your writing: Read it out loud.

This may sound overly simple. Childish even. But you know what? It works.

When you read your piece of text aloud, you’ll instantly notice the parts that don’t sound right. Where do you stumble? Where does it sound awkward or unnatural?

If it feels clunky when you say it, it will feel clunky when someone reads it.
Here’s an example I came across recently (which you can skip to save your eyes from torture):

"But most people running businesses nowadays barely think about what problem their product is solving, let alone whether their buyer is male or female, what their age range is, what their interests are, or even what haircut they have."

That’s a 47-word sentence. No one talks like that. Where would you even find the breath to say this in a conversation? (Except if you’re Eminem, then probably you can.)

Let’s translate it to “Human” language:

"Most business owners don’t even think about what problem their product solves. They also don’t consider who their customer is — their age, interests, or even their haircut."

Much better, right? Shorter sentences. Clearer points. It flows.

### Quick Tips To Write in “Human” Language
Do this to become the “superman” of writing: 

Vary sentence length. Some sentences should be long. Others should be short. Like in a real conversation.

Keep it simple. Don’t use fancy words just to sound smart. The clearer your message, the better. Avoid confusing the reader.

Write like you talk. Imagine you’re explaining something to a friend in a bar. Your writing should feel that easy and natural.

Start applying these tips to your writing and watch what happens. Your readers will thank you for it.

And you’ll thank yourself when the sales start rolling in. Cash is always good for inner peace.

Till next time.
